# SQL Server Jobs & HA/DR

This repository contains solutions to properly control and maintain **scheduled jobs on SQL Servers** with either **Availability Groups** or **Database Mirroring**.

![Cover Image](media/sql-jobs-hadr.png)

Using this solution, you can automatically control which SQL Agent jobs would be executed on which replica, based on several possible criteria (PRIMARY / SECONDARY database role, job name, job category, etc.).

After implementing this solution:

- No longer will you be needing to manually implement an HA/DR role check in each new job or job step that you create.
- Jobs would no longer be executing without actually doing anything because a database's role wasn't the right one.
- No more jobs would fail because they were executed on a secondary/read-only/unreadable database.
- MSDB job history tables would not be needlessly bloated.

This solution is an improved version of the scripts provided at the blog post [Automatically Enable or Disable Jobs Based on HADR Role](https://eitanblumin.com/2018/11/06/automatically-enable-or-disable-jobs-based-on-hadr-role/).
